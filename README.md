- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maxim.
- ğŸ¤¡ My previous GitHub accounts have been suspended due to working in SberDevices (for no reason, but anyway...)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Diffusion models and Bayesian ML.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RL. (by 2022)

I have other github accounts, please contact me if needed (klechshev dot maksim at gmail dot com)
